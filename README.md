# Network Security Design and Implementation

## Objective


The Network Security Design and Implementation project focused on designing, configuring, and securing a hierarchical network infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project aimed to establish a scalable network with OSPF routing, VLAN segmentation, and redundancy while incorporating security controls such as ACLs, NAT, and SSH. This hands-on experience enhanced understanding of network architecture, security hardening, and traffic analysis.

### Skills Learned

- Proficiency in network design with OSPF routing, VLANs, and subnetting.
- Implementation of security controls including ACLs, NAT, and encrypted authentication.
- Network traffic monitoring and analysis using built-in tools and Wireshark.
- Configuration of redundancy and fault tolerance mechanisms for network resilience.
- Practical experience with Cisco Packet Tracer for network simulation and troubleshooting.

### Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer â€“ Designed, configured, and tested network infrastructure.
